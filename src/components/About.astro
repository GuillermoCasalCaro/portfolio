            I'm Guillermo, a FullStack Developer with a strong focus on building
            intuitive, user-first interfaces using <span class="text-yellow-400"
                >React.js</span
            >, paired with solid backend development using <span
                class="text-yellow-400">C# and .NET</span
            >. I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle, from API
            design to cloud deployment using <span class="text-yellow-400"
                >Azure services</span
            >.

            I value clean code, efficient architecture, and collaborative
            environments. Whether it's maintaining CI/CD pipelines or debugging
            tricky UI bugs, I take pride in delivering reliable, scalable
            solutions. Always curious and eager to learn, Iâ€™m committed to
            growing as a developer and teammate.
